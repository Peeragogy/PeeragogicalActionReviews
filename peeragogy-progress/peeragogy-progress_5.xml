  <intention-review>
    We prepare a submission for the 2018 Connected Learning Summit.
  </intention-review>
  <what-happened>
    We have a dialogue about the “what’s next” steps from our pattern catalogue, asking what makes the Peeragogy project a sustainable learning community.
  </what-happened>
  <what-happened-perspectives>
    At the last minute, we realize we need to anonymize the paper. The content is too much about “us” to stand up well to those changes.

  <learnings-changes>
    We subsequently revise the text into a successful submission for Anticipation 2019.
  </learnings-changes>
  <what-else-should-change-going-forward>
    We should review the work that was accepted for Connected Learning Summit 2018 with more care and think about a future submission.
