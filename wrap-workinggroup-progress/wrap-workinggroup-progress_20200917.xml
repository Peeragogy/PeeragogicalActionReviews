We want to make this tool applicable to other as-yet-unknown tracks of the Project.</intention-review><what-happened>We are getting to know each other and our individual priorities and skills. This helps us identify ways we can each contribute to the unified mission/goal. Questions from non-technical participants inform the design.</what-happened><what-happened-perspectives>We are making Bratwurst. Some of us see the individual molecules of the sausage, others see the bubbling juice and anticipate how the mustard will mingle with the savory meat.</what-happened-perspectives><learnings-changes>We learned new perspectives. We discussed refinements to the sausage-making process. We learned that with persistence, eventually the participants extract value and see the end goal.</learnings-changes><what-else-should-change-going-forward>Keep investigating, stay open to refinements. Keep the END USER in mind, the non-technical person. Keep the waves coming in! Meet people/users where they are.</what-else-should-change-going-forward></peeragogical-action-review>
