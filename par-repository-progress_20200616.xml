  <intention-review>
    We want to collect our previous Peeragogical Action Reviews (PARs) into one place for easy reference and further work. In particular, these PARs can serve as “proto-patterns”: they represent little semi-formal learnings that may have transferable information in them. Before we can extract patterns, we need data, and that’s what this repository achieves.

  <what-happened>
    We’re sharing and developing a “good practice” for everyone in the project.

    <html:ul>
      <html:li>Practice: Getting in the habit of writing PARs collectively during meetings and other interactions would be a good idea</html:li>
      <html:li>Effort: Let’s contribute to finding a list of the previous PARs</html:li>
      <html:li>Technical: The repository contains XML formatted documents, we need to learn how to produce those and use them in downstream formats</html:li>
      <html:li>Mathematics: The PARs are a little bit like “tangent vectors”, maybe we can use them to understand the way the project is changing and evolving</html:li>
    </html:ul>

  <learnings-changes>
    This is a key resource of the project that has been “hidden” in the past (consider the iceberg metaphor).

  <what-else-should-change-going-forward>
    Let’s get in the habit of writing PARs here, and make them a bigger part of the book!
