  <intention-review>
    We want to run a MOOC to codesign a new way of learning together online.
  </intention-review>
  <what-happened>
    We develop an outline syllabus and budget, and submit our proposal to the Knight Foundation.
  </what-happened>
  <what-happened-perspectives>
    The details of the syllabus are meant to be worked out with students when they arrive, which is somewhat confusing; the tasks and budget are more concrete.
  </what-happened-perspectives>
  <learnings-changes>
    We have a budget breakdown for how we would spend $50,000.
  </learnings-changes>
  <what-else-should-change-going-forward>
    We should rework the syllabus around the target audienceâ€”possibly in a classroom rather than a MOOC.
