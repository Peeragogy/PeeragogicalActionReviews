  <what-happened>
    We made some progress on editing the handbook
    There was a small, but mighty group of people going through the course and it went well!

  <what-happened-perspectives>
    The regular meeting times we found in January have been invaluable in terms of keeping us moving and giving our work a heartbeat
    Like a television show pilot the course still has some kinks to work out, but it is looking very promising for the future

    Floobits is a nice online tool for editing the handbook that connects directly to GitHub, although it is not the most user friendly for everyone
